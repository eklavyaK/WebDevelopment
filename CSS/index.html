            A growing impression in comtemporary existence seems to acknowledge, the all pervading pestilent presence of corruption almost in every walk of life, as if to rest reconciled to the octopoid stranglehold of this malaise with helpless awe. The common day experiences indeed do introduce one with unfailing regularity, the veriegagted cancerous concoctions of currption with fearless impunity gnawing into the frame and fabric of the nation's essentia. Emboldened by the lucarative yields of such maligant materialism, the perpetrators of this malady have tightened their noose on the societal psyche. Individula and collective pursuits with curative interventions at all levels are thus indispensable to deliver the civil order from asphyxiating snare of this escalating venality.
