*alt+arrow keys to move the line up or down

ctrl+/ is used to comment out a line of bunch of lines in html

keeping alt pressed and clicking the mouse to another position inserts another cursor. both will work together at the same time.
This trick can be used when we want to change same thing at two different positions at the same time

*shift + enter to automatically create and place the cursor to the next line. This method is highly useful
because we don't need to cross all the tags before pressing enter

*shift+alt+j to find the next selection

*ctrl+f2(fn+f2) to select all the occurrances of the selection while placing a cursor to the end of each such occurrance
