Once upon a time there lived. His name was Vikramaditya. He was very kind and wise. He always worked for the
public good. Once he decided to take a tour of his kingdom in disguise to see whether there is any person who
is still unhappy or poor in his kingdom.
            
        He dressed as a peasant and masked his face with heavy beard and moustaches. While he was touring around
he hills, he found a sage who was in deep meditation. He went and sat before the sage or muni. He didn't disturb
the muni. Muni didn't even notice him when he sat down before him.

        when muni woke up from his meditation he saw the king and asked the reason for his arrival. King first
humbled down at muni's feet and asked him a method to know whether all the people of that kingdom are genuinely
happy or not in the rule of the king. Then muni suggested something to the king and he followed to get his answer.
