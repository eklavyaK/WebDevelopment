    the type attribute of the input tag determines the type of input to be accepted like for ex: text, file, selection, button pressing

    The value attribute specifies the value of an <input> element.
    The value attribute is used differently for different input types:
    For "button", "reset", and "submit" - it defines the text on the button
    For "text", "password", and "hidden" - it defines the initial (default) value of the input field
    For "checkbox", "radio", "image" - it defines the value associated with the input (this is also the value that is sent on submit)
    Note: The value attribute cannot be used with <input type="file">
